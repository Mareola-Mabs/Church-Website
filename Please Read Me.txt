Please ensure the instructions in this readme text sheet are adhered to.

1. To Edit the Project CSS file, please edit only the SCSS files
as they have been compiled to pure CSS using the VS Code live SASS compiler.
this will help to avoid errors as editing only the CSS and not SASS will not update the SASS file, and might cause ERRORS.
